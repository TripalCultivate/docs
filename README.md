## Overview

This repo handles our documentation. It uses Jekyll to build static pages based on Markdown with specific headmatter and Github Pages.

Github pages builds the docs automatically when things are committed to the main branch.

## Development

This repository is setup to use VSCode DevContainer. As such, clone this repo and then open it in VSCode. As long as you have the devcontainer extension installed you should get a prompt asking if you want to reopen in container --you do! Then you can open in browser once it's done building (God to Ports and open that way if you are not prompted).

The devcontainer is set to watch for changes so it will refresh each time you save a file.
