Tripal Cultivate is a collection of Tripal extension packages focused on providing intuitive data management support for breeding and pre-breeding activities to help you to

- Diversify your crossing block with an intuitive germplasm search form integrating passport, phenotypic and genotypic data.
- Streamline project management and easily incorporate pre-breeding data into your breeding workflow with a shared platform.

    - Ensure germplasm information is correctly associated with pre-breeding research data.
    - Access genotypic and phenotypic data from ongoing pre-breeding research studies when searching for parent material.
    - Easily test tools developed for pre-breeding analysis on breeding material due to shared data storage and formats.

- Customize your site by introducing tech savvy staff to built-in administrative interfaces and a vast collection of pluggable themes (i.e. change styles) and modules (i.e. add functionality) provided by Drupal and Tripal international communities.
- Integrate new visualization and data analysis tools with less developer-time due to our extensive APIs and modular, open-source framework.
