# Genotypic Data

This module package provides generic support for large-scale genotypic data, genetic maps, and QTL with importers, content pages and visualizations. 

## [Genotypic Data Import](genotypic-data/genotypic-data-import)
The genotypic data importer accomodates genotypic data stored in the VCF file format, as well as a more simplified matrix file format. These data, even large-scale datasets, are stored within Chado's relational database model with tight integration to germplasm and phenotypic data.
