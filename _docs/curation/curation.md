# Curation, File Upload and Management
This section of the documentation is designed to guide a data curator in importing and managing data into their Tripal site to properly meet to needs of the site's users. 

## [Germplasm Data](germplasm-data)
Prior to loading genotypic or phenotypic data into a Tripal site, it is first necessary to describe the germplasm for which these data pertain to. This section is where you will find how to import germplasm accessions, germplasm crosses, and to define germplasm collections for your site.

## [Phenotypic Data](phenotypic-data)
This section describes how to capture measurements right after collection into a holding space that is kept private yet shareable among your users. You will be guided on how to properly describe various traits to ensure re-usability of these data, so that you will be prepared once you receive phenotypic data that is ready to be shared with the broader community.

## [Genotypic Data](genotypic-data)
With the rise of sequencing technology, it is becoming more common to handle large-scale genotypic datasets. This section will describe how to upload genotypic data through the interface but also directly through the command-line, depending on the scale of the dataset. Additionally, you can also manage and describe VCF files for distribution among your users if the data is not refined or deemed appropriate for the database.

## [Genetic Maps](genetic-maps)
If researchers are developing linkage maps and QTLs, these can be imported into the database and properly described using separate map and QTL importers.
