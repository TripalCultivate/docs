## Describe New Traits

There are two ways to add traits/measurements to an experiment. One is during data collection spreadsheet preparing, the other is during data uploading.

### The first method
**Definition**, **Unit**, and **Desctibe the method used** of any new trait can be described through Manage Experiment Assets.

### The second method
During file upload, users are requested to describe each new trait by filling the **Definition**, **Unit**, and **Desctibe the method used** text box.
