# User Documentation

As these modules are currently under active development, there is currently no user documentation at this time. To get an idea regarding future functionality, please refer to the [Curation, File Upload and Management](docs/curation/curation) section.

Once released, you can expect documentation that will guide users (with screenshots) on forward-facing tools and content pages, such as searches and visualizations.

If you require more information on what to expect from these modules, please feel free to [open a discussion on Github!](https://github.com/orgs/TripalCultivate/discussions)
