# Administration
This section of the documentation is designed to guide a site administrator to install, configure and manage any of the TripalCultivate modules.

## [Installation](installation)
Find out what the requirements are, how to select the right modules for your site's needs, and what order to install them in this section.

## [Setup and Configuration](configuration)
After a module has been installed, there is some configuration that takes place before it is ready for use. This includes setting of controlled vocabulary terms, default values for forms and more.

## [Ongoing Site Management](management)
Tasks that occur semi-regularly such as file management, publishing new content, and updating materialized views are explained here.
