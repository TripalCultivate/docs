# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing these this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.

# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Sharing data for smarter agriculture! Tripal Cultivate is a collection of
  Tripal extension packages focused on providing intuitive data management
  support for agriculture research groups. There is rich support for germplasm,
  genetic data (e.g. genetic maps, QTL, GWAS), genotypic data (e.g. large scale
  VCF datasets) and trait data (e.g. observation, biochemistry and high-throughput
  phenotypic data).
